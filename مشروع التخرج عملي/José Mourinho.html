                <h5 class="car2">Football Manager</h5>
                <p class="car3"> After an uneventful career as a midfielder in the Portuguese League, Mourinho moved into coaching, first as a translator for Sir Bobby Robson at Sporting Lisbon and Porto, before succeeding as an assistant at Barcelona under Robson and his successor Louis van Gaal. After impressing in brief managerial stints at Benfica and Uniao Leiria, Mourinho returned to Porto as coach in 2002, where he won two Portuguese league titles, a Portuguese Cup, a UEFA Cup and a UEFA Champions League, the club's first European Cup since 1987. This success earned him a move to England with Chelsea in 2004, where he won two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and two League Cups in his three seasons at the club, before leaving in 2007 amid rumors of falling out with club owner Roman Abramovich.</p>
